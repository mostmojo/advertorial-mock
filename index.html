					• Adam Dawson’s wife left him soon after their baby’s arrival <br />
					• Single dad was struggling to make ends meet but found something that completely changed their life around! <br />
					• He now admits that this was the best thing that could have ever happened to them! <br />
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					Adam Dawson was excited about becoming a dad for the first time. But a few months after the baby came his wife decided to start a new life alone, leaving her family behind. <br />
					What Adam didn’t know was that this would change his life in a surprisingly good way!...
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					We found Adam Dawson through an online support group for single parents and his story truly amazed us! Here’s how he describes everything that went on the past couple of months. <br /><br />

					“My wife was the love of my life, but a while after she gave birth she started neglecting the baby and complaining about how her life had changed.. <br /> <br />

					At first I thought that it was just the stress and the hormones taking over, but as time went on, things only got worse. I was coming back from work to find a screaming baby in the living room while my wife would be sound asleep in the bedroom. <br /><br />

					I was doing as much as I could around the house to help her out, but no matter what I did, her attitude towards me and our baby wouldn’t change!” <br /> <br />

					Adam decided to take some time off work to be closer to his family. He thought that maybe his wife needed him around the first few months, but he quickly realized that all she wanted to do was go out and party with her friends.
