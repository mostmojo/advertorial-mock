					• Adam Dawson’s wife left him soon after their baby’s arrival
					<br />
					• Single dad was struggling to make ends meet but found something that completely changed
					their life around!
					<br />
					• He now admits that this was the best thing that could have ever happened to them!
					<br />
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					Adam Dawson was excited about becoming a dad for the first time. But a few months after
					the baby came his
					wife decided to start a new life alone, leaving her family behind.
					<br />
					What Adam didn’t know was that this would change his life in a surprisingly good way!...
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					We found Adam Dawson through an online support group for single parents and his story
					truly amazed us!
					Here’s how he describes everything that went on the past couple of months.
					<br />
					<br />

					“My wife was the love of my life, but a while after she gave birth she started neglecting
					the baby and
					complaining about how her life had changed..
					<br />
					<br />

					At first I thought that it was just the stress and the hormones taking over, but as time
					went on, things
					only got worse. I was coming back from work to find a screaming baby in the living room
					while my wife would
					be sound asleep in the bedroom.
					<br />
					<br />

					I was doing as much as I could around the house to help her out, but no matter what I did,
					her attitude
					towards me and our baby wouldn’t change!”
					<br />
					<br />

					Adam decided to take some time off work to be closer to his family. He thought that maybe
					his wife needed
					him around the first few months, but he quickly realized that all she wanted to do was go
					out and party with
					her friends.

			<div class="content">
				<p class="content-p">
					“She told me that she realized she was too young to take care of a baby all the time and
					just wanted to feel
					free again!
					<br />
					<br />
					She would go out in the morning and come back after midnight, pretending that all of this
					was OK!”
				</p>
				<p class="content-p-bold">
					According to Adam, what happened next changed his life forever..
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					“I had to go to the supermarket to get some diapers.. I couldn’t have gone for more than
					20 minutes, but
					when I came back she wasn’t there and all her clothes were missing! Imagine that our baby
					was sleeping in
					our room! I was going crazy! I didn’t know what to do!”
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					Adam found a note on the table from her, saying that she couldn’t do this anymore and that
					she wanted to
					start her life again.
					<br />
					<br />
					“She asked me not to call her again or ever look for her..”
				</p>
				<p class="content-p-bold">
					Adam was devastated, but things were about to get worse..
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					“Two days later, my Manager called to tell me that I had to go back to work or I would be
					fired! I tried
					explaining the situation but he didn’t seem to care!”
					<br />
					<br />
					Adam’s Manager got furious and fired him on the spot…
					<br />
					<br />
					“I was hopeless and felt like my life was over! My parents were living 3 hours away so
					dropping off the baby
					everyday to go to work wasn’t an option! Not to mention that I was out of a job so I had
					to find something
					ASAP to be able to provide for my baby daughter!”

			<div class="content">
				<p class="content-p">
					Adam went online to try and find a new job, but it was harder than he expected!
					<br />
					<br />
					“I’d been working at that company for years, and getting a decent salary! But having to
					start fresh would
					mean a huge decrease in my income and that really stressed me out!
					<br />
					<br />
					I spent hours on my computer trying to find something good but to no end. After a few days
					of research I
					realized that I would have to settle for anything that could put some food on our table
					and was looking for
					anything that involved flexible hours or working from home so I could be with my daughter
					as much as I
					could!
					<br />
					<br />
				</p>
				<p class="content-p-bold">
					That next click changed everything…
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					I was about to check another job opening online when this ad popped up about an online
					casino. I was going
					to delete it, but I accidentally clicked on it. When the page opened all I could see was a
					bonus offer by a
					casino called
					<a class="p-link" href="#">Europa!</a>
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					I don’t know why I didn’t just go back to my search. Maybe it was the bright colours or
					the fact that I just
					needed to distract myself from everything that was happening in my life.. Or maybe it was
					the fact that they
					were promoting an offer of
					<a class="p-link" href="#">100% Bonus up to $100 + $2400 Welcome Bonus for just $5!</a>
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					My old self would have never considered this! I had never played in a casino in my life..
					But at that moment
					I was desperate and all I could think of was that
					<a class="p-link" href="#">$5</a>
					was nothing if I could end up with a couple of thousands!
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					I signed up and started playing, realizing that this was much easier than I thought, not
					to mention fun!
					They had so many games, and with that huge bonus they gave me I could play for hours!
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					I decided to play a slot game - to be honest, I just liked the sound effects because they
					made me feel like
					I was inside a real Casino! A few spins later, my daughter woke up from her nap so I went
					to get her, but
					not before spinning one more time.. I didn’t even stick around to see what happened. Came
					back a few minutes
					later with my baby in my arms and saw that a huge
					<a class="p-link" href="#">Jackpot</a>
					sign was on my screen!"
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					According to Adam, he didn’t realize what had really happened, until he saw the amount..
					<br />
					<br />
					“
					<a class="p-link" href="#">$1,247,356!</a>
					I couldn't believe it! Was that real? Was it all mine? Right when I was thinking that I
					wouldn’t be able to
					take care of my daughter, I became a millionaire? That was impossible for me to
					comprehend!”.
					<br />
					<br />
					Adam contacted
					<a class="p-link" href="#">Europa Casino</a>
					right away and they confirmed his
					<a class="p-link" href="#">huge win!</a>

					“I just started crying! One click just changed my life! I was holding my daughter in my
					arms and I knew that
					everything was going to be OK now!”
					<br />
					<br />

					Adam is now a full-time dad and he couldn’t be happier!
					<br />
					<br />

					“I love spending time with my daughter and now that I don’t have to worry about finding a
					job, I can just be
					there for her all the time!
					<br />
					<br />

					I’d honestly like to thank Europa Casino, because if it wasn’t for that bonus offer, I
					would still be
					running around looking for ways to provide for my baby!”, he says.

					From Sarah:
				</p>
				<p class="content-p">
					"When I heard about Adam’s story, I thought it was too good to be true, so I investigated
					further. After a
					few days of research and investigation, I found out
					<a class="p-link" href="#">Europa Casino</a>
					is actually one of the popular online casinos in the world, yet was only recently allowed
					by law to accept
					Canadian citizens.
					<br />
					<br />

					There are rumors
					<a class="p-link" href="#">Europa Casino</a>
					is "loosening up" their games for new Canadian players. This means they are making it
					<a class="p-link" href="#">easier to win money for a limited time</a>
					to help their brand gain popularity in Canada.
					<br />
					<br />

					I did notice
					<a class="p-link" href="#">Europa Casino</a>
					is extremely strict on only accepting users ages 18 and up, with no exceptions. When I
					signed up, I had to
					enter my credit card info as verification of my age. I was a little nervous, yet they
					assured me I would not
					be charged a single cent.
					<br />
					<br />

					Turns out they were right. As soon as I passed verification, I was given access to all
					their games along
					with up to 100% Bonus Up To
					<a class="p-link" href="#">$100 + $2400 Welcome Bonus For Just $5</a>
					to win the
					<a class="p-link" href="#">jackpot of $1,001,940.</a>
					I checked my credit card statement the next day and indeed there were no hidden charges.
					<br />
					<br />

					I used my welcome bonus over the next three days whenever I was bored. The third day was
					my lucky one, as I
					actually won some money. I couldn't believe it! I won
					<a class="p-link" href="#">$1,680 from the "Age Of The Gods"</a>
					game! It wasn't life-changing money or anything but I was very pleased! Now I could pay
					off the rest of my
					credit card bills and use some money for a new pair of shoes.
					<br />
					<br />

					<i>I received my winnings in my bank account almost instantly.</i>
