						• Adam Dawson’s wife left him soon after their baby’s arrival
						<br />
						• Single dad was struggling to make ends meet but found something that completely changed their life around!
						<br />
						• He now admits that this was the best thing that could have ever happened to them!
						<br />
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						Adam Dawson was excited about becoming a dad for the first time. But a few months after the baby came his
						wife decided to start a new life alone, leaving her family behind.
						<br />
						What Adam didn’t know was that this would change his life in a surprisingly good way!...
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						We found Adam Dawson through an online support group for single parents and his story truly amazed us!
						Here’s how he describes everything that went on the past couple of months.
						<br />
						<br />

						“My wife was the love of my life, but a while after she gave birth she started neglecting the baby and
						complaining about how her life had changed..
						<br />
						<br />

						At first I thought that it was just the stress and the hormones taking over, but as time went on, things
						only got worse. I was coming back from work to find a screaming baby in the living room while my wife would
						be sound asleep in the bedroom.
						<br />
						<br />

						I was doing as much as I could around the house to help her out, but no matter what I did, her attitude
						towards me and our baby wouldn’t change!”
						<br />
						<br />

						Adam decided to take some time off work to be closer to his family. He thought that maybe his wife needed
						him around the first few months, but he quickly realized that all she wanted to do was go out and party with
						her friends.

						“She told me that she realized she was too young to take care of a baby all the time and just wanted to feel
						free again!
						<br />
						<br />
						She would go out in the morning and come back after midnight, pretending that all of this was OK!”
					</p>
					<p class="content-p-bold">
						According to Adam, what happened next changed his life forever..
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						“I had to go to the supermarket to get some diapers.. I couldn’t have gone for more than 20 minutes, but
						when I came back she wasn’t there and all her clothes were missing! Imagine that our baby was sleeping in
						our room! I was going crazy! I didn’t know what to do!”
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						Adam found a note on the table from her, saying that she couldn’t do this anymore and that she wanted to
						start her life again.
						<br />
						<br />
						“She asked me not to call her again or ever look for her..”
					</p>
					<p class="content-p-bold">
						Adam was devastated, but things were about to get worse..
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						“Two days later, my Manager called to tell me that I had to go back to work or I would be fired! I tried
						explaining the situation but he didn’t seem to care!”
						<br />
						<br />
						Adam’s Manager got furious and fired him on the spot…
						<br />
						<br />
						“I was hopeless and felt like my life was over! My parents were living 3 hours away so dropping off the baby
						everyday to go to work wasn’t an option! Not to mention that I was out of a job so I had to find something
						ASAP to be able to provide for my baby daughter!”

						Adam went online to try and find a new job, but it was harder than he expected!
						<br />
						<br />
						“I’d been working at that company for years, and getting a decent salary! But having to start fresh would
						mean a huge decrease in my income and that really stressed me out!
						<br />
						<br />
						I spent hours on my computer trying to find something good but to no end. After a few days of research I
						realized that I would have to settle for anything that could put some food on our table and was looking for
						anything that involved flexible hours or working from home so I could be with my daughter as much as I
						could!
						<br />
						<br />
					</p>
					<p class="content-p-bold">
						That next click changed everything…
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						I was about to check another job opening online when this ad popped up about an online casino. I was going
						to delete it, but I accidentally clicked on it. When the page opened all I could see was a bonus offer by a
						casino called
						<a class="p-link" href="#">Europa!</a>
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						I don’t know why I didn’t just go back to my search. Maybe it was the bright colours or the fact that I just
						needed to distract myself from everything that was happening in my life.. Or maybe it was the fact that they
						were promoting an offer of
						<a class="p-link" href="#">100% Bonus up to $100 + $2400 Welcome Bonus for just $5!</a>
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						My old self would have never considered this! I had never played in a casino in my life.. But at that moment
						I was desperate and all I could think of was that
						<a class="p-link" href="#">$5</a>
						was nothing if I could end up with a couple of thousands!
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						I signed up and started playing, realizing that this was much easier than I thought, not to mention fun!
						They had so many games, and with that huge bonus they gave me I could play for hours!
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						I decided to play a slot game - to be honest, I just liked the sound effects because they made me feel like
						I was inside a real Casino! A few spins later, my daughter woke up from her nap so I went to get her, but
						not before spinning one more time.. I didn’t even stick around to see what happened. Came back a few minutes
						later with my baby in my arms and saw that a huge
						<a class="p-link" href="#">Jackpot</a>
						sign was on my screen!"
					</p>
					<p class="content-p">
						According to Adam, he didn’t realize what had really happened, until he saw the amount..
						<br />
						<br />
						“
						<a class="p-link" href="#">$1,247,356!</a>
						I couldn't believe it! Was that real? Was it all mine? Right when I was thinking that I wouldn’t be able to
						take care of my daughter, I became a millionaire? That was impossible for me to comprehend!”. Adam contacted
						Europa Casino right away and they confirmed his huge win!
